     * @param   rowPins
     *          A list of pin numbers connected to the rows of the button
     *          matrix. These pins will be driven LOW (Lo-Z).
     * @param   colPins
     *          A list of pin numbers connected to the columns of the button
     *          matrix. These pins will be used as inputs, and the internal
     *          pull-up resistor will be enabled.
     * @note    The lists of pins are copied. This means that they can be 
     *          initialized with a brace-enclosed initializer list.
     * @param   addresses
     *          A 2D array of dimensions (nb_rows Ã— nb_cols) containing the
     *          note numbers.
     * @note    The list of addresses is not copied. It should be a reference to
     *          a 2-dimensional array. This means that initializing `addresses`
     *          with a brace-enclosed initializer list is not allowed.
     * @param   channel
     *          The MIDI channel. [1, 16]
     * @param   velocity
     *          The MIDI Note velocity. [1, 127]
