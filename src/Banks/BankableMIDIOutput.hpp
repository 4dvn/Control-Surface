/**
 * @brief   A base class for all MIDIOutputElement#s that can be banked.
 * 
 * @note    These elements don't have to be updated when the bank setting is 
 *          changed, because they poll the bank setting each time they send a
 *          MIDI event.  
 *          They are not added to the bank, they just keep a reference to the 
 *          bank they're a part of.  
 * 
 * @note    To prevent 'sticky' notes (i.e. a button is pressed, a note on is
 *          sent, the bank is changed, the button is released, and the note off
 *          is sent to a different address, causing the first note to keep on 
 *          playing indefinitely), there must be a way to lock the bank setting
 *          while a note is playing. Then when it is no longer playing, the 
 *          bank setting is unlocked.
