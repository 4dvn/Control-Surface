/**
 * @example OLED-Demo.ino
 * @brief An extensive example demonstrating the use of DisplayElement%s 
 *        to display information from the DAW on a small OLED display.
 *        
 * The example displays the cursor time location, play and record status,
 * and for each of the 8 first tracks, it displays:
 * mute, solo, record ready, pan, and VU level meter with peak indicator.
 * 
 * @image html "OLED-Demo.png"
 * 
 * Using a BankSelector, it displays two channels at once, and you can
 * cycle through four banks to display all 8 tracks.
 * 
 * There are two rotary encoders that control the pan of the selected
 * tracks, two mute, solo, record, and select buttons for the tracks, 
 * and a play and record button.
