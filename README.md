# MIDI_controller
This is a library for creating a MIDI controller using an Arduino board.
It enables you to easily create MIDI controllers or instruments with very few lines of code. It supports digital inputs, like pushbuttons and switches, analog inputs, like faders, potentiometers, light sensors, and rotary encoders, like jogwheels. 
The library works on pretty much all Arduino and Teensy boards, like the Arduino Uno, Mega, Zero, Due, Leonardo, Micro, Teensy 3.2, ...

It uses a MIDI-over-USB connection to connect to your computer, and can be used in your favourite DJ or DAW software.
