# Control Surface
An Arduino library for MIDI control surfaces (input and output).  
## UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Should not be considered stable. API is bound to change in the near future. 
Master might not even compile on some boards.

## Documentation
The automatically generated Doxygen documentation for this library can be found 
[here](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface/Doc/Doxygen/index.html). 
(incomplete)

## Building and running the tests
For help compiling and running the tests, see [Tests.md](Tests.md).
